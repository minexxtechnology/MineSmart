# Project Name
MineSmart: Integrated blockchain platform to connect artisanal miners to the world and formalise the sector.

# Project Description
MineSmart platform works along the artisanal and small-scale mining value chain. 1 in 8 people in Sub Saharan Africa depend on small scale mining for a living yet it is characterised by funding conflict and child labour. MineSmart is a blockchain platform that is used at the mine site to formalise operations using digital payments and IoT. 

# Setup
Minexx take an integration first approach to accelerate the impact of technology they create and get a product into market as quickly as possible.

Minesmart has been built on top of existing technologies @Zoho Vertical CRM (https://github.com/zoho/zcrm-php-sdk) and @Finboot. Minexx technology includes the APIs between the CRM module, blockchain stamping, digital payments and additional biometrics integrations to come. 

# Using MineSmart
1.Creating an account 

To create an account follow this link: https://crm.minesmart.minexx.co

2.Available workflows
 
    2.1 Adding Miners
    
After logging in MineSmart app, miners staff are added by clicking on the Miners tab. Once in the Miners tab, after clicking on the + button at the top right side of the screen, a form opens up where the miners identification information can be entered including the upload of their ID card, biometrics and mobile money information. 

Miners can also be added through the upload of an Excel or CSV file by clicking on the 'Import' button. This can be done through the Mobile phone application.
    
     2.2 Creating miners' teams
    
       2.2.1 Setting up a team leader

To set up a team leader, click on the Miner Teams tab: The 'Create Miner team' form opens up where the team leaders' information can be entered. This can also be achieved through the 'Import' button that allows the upload of large datasets Excel or CSV files. 
      
       2.2.2 Adding miners under a team leader
      
 Miners are assigned to the team leader(s) in the Miners section located at the bottom of the Miner Teams area using the 'Assign' button. Miners previously created in the Miners tabs can be added in one click from the available lists.
    
     2.3 Setting mines and pits
    
The same logic as above applies to set up multiples sites and corresponding pits using the forms for manual entry or the upload of Excel/CSV files with the possibilities to map miners, teams and mine sites in few clicks.

     2.4 Tracking the minerals supply chain

The Tracking tab gives you access to the 7 stageviews from the digging all the way through the International Trading, including two additional views for Smelters and Tech manufacturers companies. Mine managers can update the supply chain stage for every minerals batch and follow it through a tracking dashboard while viewing the stages history and resources involved at each stage. 

         2.4.1 Stageview 1: Production
         
Mine managers create tracks at the producation stage, to track their poduction throughout various processing activities (digging, washing, crushing, filtering, packaging and electronic tagging). A batch constitutes an output of minerals that has been processed and weighted. The mine manager enters in the Batch screen, the mineral type, assigns the corresponding team of diggers, the corresponding mines/pits, the value, the electronic tag (barcode) attached to the bag.

         2.4.2 Stageview 2: Minerals purchase
         
In this stage, the system processes payments including the electronic payments to the miners's teams.
Payment details (mobile money, digital wallet if applies) are added by mine managers to the production batches configured in the previous stage.
At every stageview, a summary tab labelled 'Stage History' allows to visualise all the historical stages for the current minerals batch displayed on the screen in addition of all miners involved in the digging of the minerals batch.

         2.4.3 Stageview 3: Transport
This stage helps the mine manager to collate all the transport documentation and authorisations related to a batch of minerals shipped out the mine. 
The transport view carries over information related to the traceability of the miners, mines and payments involved for all minerals batches beig shipped out the mine sites.

         2.4.4 Stageview 4: Export
         
At the Export stageview, mine managers are tagging minerals batches that are ready for Export. Licensing fees, trading permits, tax clearance, export declarations are attached to the corresponding minerals batches.
 
         2.4.5 Stageview 5: International Trading
         
This stage relates to the International Trading phase, where minerals are sold to comptoirs or other participants in the mining industry. MineSmart allows mining company to keep track of the history and records related to a mineral batch and making it available to EU consumers concerned about the ethical sourcing  oftech products.

         2.4.6 Stageview 6 & 7: Smelters and Manufacturers
          
These two views are specific dashboards that allow Smelters and Manufacturers from the tech industry to ensure that their are sourcing their minerals in an ethical manner. All the information related to the end-to-end supply chain is accessible from the dashaboard.

MineSmart connects miners to the world, by bringing transparency to mineral origin data and by empowering tech companies to improve the situation for miners.
